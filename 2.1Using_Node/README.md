# Using Node.js

This section covers the basics of using Node.js and some fundamental command-line operations.

## Node.js Commands

Node.js provides a runtime environment to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Here are some essential commands for interacting with Node.js:

-   `node file.js`: Executes a JavaScript file named `file.js`.
-   `node`: Starts the interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), allowing you to execute JavaScript code directly in your terminal.
-   `node --version` or `node -v`: Displays the currently installed version of Node.js.
-   `node --help`: Shows a list of available command-line options and how to use them.
-   `node -e "script"`: Executes a small piece of JavaScript code directly from the command line. For example, `node -e "console.log(1+1)"`.
-   `node -p "expression"`: Evaluates a JavaScript expression and prints the result.
-   `node --check file.js`: Checks the syntax of a script without executing it.
-   `node --require module file.js`: Preloads a specified module before running the script.
-   `node --trace-warnings file.js`: Provides stack traces for any warnings generated during script execution.
-   `node --max-old-space-size=SIZE file.js`: Sets the maximum memory size for the V8 JavaScript engine (in megabytes).

## Basic Bash Commands

Bash is a common command-line shell used in many operating systems. Here are some fundamental commands that are useful when working with Node.js projects:

-   `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
-   `cd`: Changes the current working directory.
-   `pwd`: Prints the path of the current working directory.
-   `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
-   `touch`: Creates a new empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
-   `cp`: Copies files or directories.
-   `mv`: Moves or renames files or directories.
-   `rm`: Deletes files or directories.
-   `cat`: Displays the content of one or more files.
-   `grep`: Searches for specific patterns within text files.
-   `echo`: Displays text or variable values.
-   `chmod`: Changes the permissions of a file or directory.
-   `sudo`: Executes a command with administrative (superuser) privileges.
